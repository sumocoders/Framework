# Initial bundle

## Naming convention

All official bundles use the same naming convention. The convention is fairly 
easy: "FrameworkXXXBundle", where XXX is replaced with a descriptive name of 
the basic functionality.


## Minimal bundle

A minimum bundle contains at least the following files

* .gitignore
* .travis.yml
* composer.json
* phpunit.xml.dist
* README.md
* SumoCodersFrameworkXXXBundle.php
* Resources/doc/index.md
* Resources/meta/LICENSE

Below I will explain what each file should do/contains.


### .gitignore

This file contains some files/folders that should be ignored by git.

    /vendor/
    composer.lock
    coverage.xml
    
The `vendor`-folder is ignored as the Bundle won't exists on its own, and the 
dependencies will be installed in your project. But the dependencies are 
required for testing.

`composer.lock` isn't submit as it will be ignored when the bundle is installed
in a project.

`coverag.xml` is a file that will be generated when running the tests in our 
CI-tool. Normally it won't be generated when running the tests manually.
    

### .travis.yml

This file will configure Travis CI to build and test our bundle/project.

    language: php
    
    matrix:
      include:
        - php: 5.4
        - php: 5.5
        - php: 5.6
        - php: 7
        - php: nightly
        - php: hhvm
        - php: hhvm-nightly
      allow_failures:
        - php: 7
        - php: nightly
        - php: hhvm
        - php: hhvm-nightly
    
    before_script:
      - travis_retry composer self-update
      - travis_retry composer install --no-interaction --prefer-source --dev
    
    script:
      - vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose --coverage-text  --coverage-clover=coverage.clover
    
    after_success:
      - wget https://scrutinizer-ci.com/ocular.phar
      - php ocular.phar code-coverage:upload --format=php-clover coverage.clover

There are several sections in this yml-file. 

The `matrix` defines which versions of PHP we will test against and which are 
allowed to fail. For now the minimum is PHP 5.4 until 5.6 that should pass the
tests.

The `before_script` defines which commands should be run before the actual 
scripts are run. We make sure composer is updated and the vendors are installed.

The `script` defines which scripts should be ran, here we run the tests. As we 
install phpunit as a dependency we use that executable. As you see we output 
a coverage-report as it will be handled by Scrutinizer.

The `after_success` section will send the coverage-report to Scrutinizer once 
the scripts are finished.


### composer.json

This file contains the dependencies and required attributes for publication on 
[packagist.org](http://www.packagist.org).

sections: Installation and Usage.

    # Getting Started With FrameworkXXXBundle
    
    ## Installation
    
    Add FrameworkXXXBundle as a requirement in your composer.json:
    
    ```
    {
        "require": {
            "sumocoders/framework-xxx-bundle": "dev-master"

# Create a (public) repo

Once the initial folder structure is created you can push the initial state 
into your versioning system. At SumoCoders we use gitlab or GitHub for our 
public bundles.

For a public repo on GitHub you can follow the steps below:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com).
2. Log in with your Github-account.
3. Click "New repository".
4. Give it the same name as your bundle, eg.: FrameworkXXXBundle.
5. Fill in the Description.
6. Click "Create repository".
7. Open the settings.
8. Open the tab "Options".
9. Disable "Wikis".
10. Enable "Issues".

Now you can push the initial state by running the commands below:

1. Open up Terminal.app
2. `cd` to the correct directory
3. `git init`
4. `git add .`
5. `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
6. `git remote add origin https://github.com/xxx/xxx.git`
7. `git push -u origin/master`

If you are publishing a bundle as a member of SumoCoders

* Make sure you add it under the SumoCoders Organization
* Give the "PHP Team" access under Collaborators.
